# discord-task-bot

![CI](https://github.com/philaconvalley/discord-task-bot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Discord bot for PhilaCon Valley task assignments, due-date reminders, and
Scheduled Event creation. PhilaCon Valley is a Philadelphia tech community,
and this bot runs its task coordination in Discord.

## How it works

TypeScript on Node 20, running as one long-lived `discord.js` client.
`src/index.ts` loads configuration from the environment, opens the SQLite
database, wires up the slash commands, and starts the reminder cron once the
client is ready. Command errors are caught in the dispatcher and answered with
an ephemeral reply rather than taking the process down.

**Commands**

- `/task add | list | done | delete` (`src/commands/task.ts`) — assign a task
  to a Discord user with a due date, list tasks filtered by assignee or
  status, mark a task done, or delete it. Due dates are typed in plain
  language, e.g. `friday` or `july 17`.
- `/event add` (`src/commands/event.ts`) — create a Discord Scheduled Event
  from a name, start time, end time, and location, and reply with the event
  URL. Requires the bot's `Manage Events` permission.

Command definitions are registered to the guild by `npm run deploy-commands`
(`src/deploy-commands.ts`), separate from running the bot.

**Storage**

Tasks are stored in SQLite through `better-sqlite3`. `src/db.ts` creates the
`tasks` table on startup, and every read and write goes through
`src/repositories/taskRepository.ts`, so command handlers and the reminder job
never issue SQL themselves. That boundary is also what makes the data layer
testable against an in-memory database.

**Reminders**

`src/reminderJob.ts` schedules a `node-cron` job at 09:00 America/New_York. It
finds open tasks due today or tomorrow, posts one message per reminder to
`TASKS_CHANNEL_ID` mentioning the assignee, and then flags the task
(`reminded_day_before` / `reminded_due_date`) so the same reminder is not sent
again on a later run.

**Dates**

`src/lib/parseDate.ts` wraps `chrono-node` to turn typed input into a date,
resolving ambiguous input forward in time. `src/lib/date.ts` holds the
timezone-aware conversion to `YYYY-MM-DD`. Dates are stored and compared in
America/New_York, so "due today" means today in Philadelphia no matter which
timezone the host runs in.

**Configuration**

`src/config.ts` requires `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `GUILD_ID`,
`TASKS_CHANNEL_ID`, and `DB_PATH`. If any are absent it throws at startup
naming the missing ones, so a misconfigured deploy fails immediately instead
of behaving oddly later. See `.env.example`.

**Tests**

Vitest suites in `tests/` cover configuration loading (`config.test.ts`),
date conversion (`date.test.ts`), due-date parsing (`parseDate.test.ts`), and
the task repository including the reminder query (`taskRepository.test.ts`).

## Local development

1. `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (see "Discord setup"
   below for where to find them).
3. `npm run dev` — runs the bot with live reload against your `.env` config.

## Discord setup

1. Create an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications.
2. Under **Bot**, create a bot user and copy the token into `DISCORD_TOKEN`.
3. Copy the **Application ID** (General Information tab) into
   `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.
4. Under **Bot**, scroll to **Authorization Flow** and turn **Requires OAuth2
   Code Grant** OFF. It's on by default for new applications and silently
   breaks the invite link below (see Troubleshooting).
5. Under **OAuth2 → URL Generator**, check the `bot` and
   `applications.commands` scopes, then under bot permissions check
   `View Channels`, `Send Messages`, and `Manage Events`. Open the generated
   URL and invite the bot to the PhilaCon Valley server.
6. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (Settings → Advanced), right-click the
   server icon → Copy Server ID → `GUILD_ID`. Right-click the `#tasks`
   channel → Copy Channel ID → `TASKS_CHANNEL_ID`.
7. If `#tasks` is a private channel, open its channel settings → Permissions
   → Add members or roles → add the bot, with View Channel and Send Messages
   allowed. Slash-command replies work in a private channel without this,
   but the reminder cron's direct channel posts do not (see Troubleshooting).
8. Register slash commands: `npm run deploy-commands`. Re-run this any time
   command definitions change.

## Deploying to Railway

1. Push this repo to GitHub under the `philaconvalley` org.
2. In Railway, create a new service from this GitHub repo (existing Hobby
   plan project).
3. Add a volume mounted at `/data`.
4. Set environment variables: `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`,
   `GUILD_ID`, `TASKS_CHANNEL_ID`, and `DB_PATH=/data/tasks.db`.
5. Deploy. Railway runs `npm run build` then `npm run start` automatically
   (Nixpacks detects the `build` script).
6. Run `npm run deploy-commands` once (locally, with the same `.env` values
   as production) to register the slash commands to the guild.

`main` is connected to this Railway service — every push to `main` (i.e.
every merged PR) auto-deploys. There's no manual `railway up` step in normal
operation.

## Testing & CI

- `npm test` runs the Vitest suite locally.
- Every push and pull request against `main` runs `npm ci`, `npm run build`
  (TypeScript check), and `npm test` via GitHub Actions
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). `main` is branch-protected to require this
  check before merging — work in a branch and open a PR rather than pushing
  directly to `main`.

## Troubleshooting / Gotchas

Real issues hit setting this up the first time, kept here so they don't
have to be rediscovered:

**Discord invite link fails with "Integration requires code grant."**
New Discord applications default to **Requires OAuth2 Code Grant** = on,
under the **Bot** page's **Authorization Flow** section. This blocks the
plain `bot` + `applications.commands` invite link the OAuth2 URL Generator
produces. Turn it off, save, and regenerate the invite link.

**Reminders never post, but slash commands work fine in the same channel**
If `#tasks` (or whatever `TASKS_CHANNEL_ID` points to) is a private channel,
a slash-command reply can still render there because it rides on the
interaction itself — but the reminder cron's `channel.send()` is a direct
channel post, which needs the bot to actually have channel access. Add the
bot to that channel's permissions (View Channel + Send Messages). The
failure surfaces as `DiscordAPIError[50001]: Missing Access` in the logs.

**Railway build fails on `better-sqlite3` with a Python/node-gyp error**
`better-sqlite3` ships prebuilt binaries for common Node versions; if
Railway's Nixpacks builder auto-selects a very new Node version with no
matching prebuild, npm falls back to compiling from source via node-gyp,
which needs Python — not present in the build image, so it fails with
`Could not find any Python installation to use`. This is why
`package.json`'s `engines.node` is pinned to an exact `"20.x"` rather than
an open range like `">=20"` — an open range lets Nixpacks pick the newest
available Node instead of a version with a working prebuild. Don't loosen
this pin without confirming the target Node version has a `better-sqlite3`
prebuild for it.
